        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Gracie Ciceric. I am a third year undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside. I am majoring in psychology, with a special interest in occupational therapy. Some interesting facts about me are that I was a student athlete in high school, I was a part of a club called Piece of Peer Counseling (POPC), and I did over 150 hours of community service in high school. <br><br>

        As a student athlete, I advanced to junior varsity in volleyball, before I decided to take a step back to focus on my studies. While I was on the team, I learned the value of time management skills, punctuation, and determination. During my freshman year of high school, I earned the ‚ÄúCoaches Choice Award,‚Äù and was acknowledged for my leadership skills on and off the court. During my senior year of high school, I earned a leadership position as a Piece of Peer Counseling (POPC) Leader, after already being in the program for one quarter. As a leader of POPC, my duties included: creating fun activities for underclassmen to participate in, guiding students through homework assignments, and collaborating with my peer leaders and teachers to maintain the club‚Äôs status. Throughout my high school career, and part of my middle school career, I was an AVID student. AVID stands for Advanced Via Individual Determination. It is a club designed to help students succeed in school through the use of cornell notes, binder checks, tutorial request forms, and community service. Every quarter we were required to complete 12 hours of community service, on or off campus. Some of the community service I completed was picking up trash at my local park, spending time with sick and elderly dogs through the Frosted Faces Foundation, and picking fruit for the elderly and poverty-stricken through the Backyard Produce Project. I also volunteered at local elementary, middle, and high school events, and helped tutor underclassmen. <br><br>

        Being a student athlete, POPC Leader, AVID student, and peer tutor, helped me become a better student and person by teaching me leadership skills. With these experiences and skills, I became inspired to help others. That determination mixed with my love for science and psychology, resulted in my decision to pursue psychology as a major. Since attending the University of California, Riverside, my love for psychology has expanded exponentially, as well as my desire to help others, especially those who are incapable of advocating for themselves. That said, I have chosen to join the Psi Chi Club on campus, which is the official psychology club for UCR. Although I am only a Prospective Member at the moment, I attend almost every meeting and social event. I was also chosen to be one of the Market Coordinators for the 2024 Psi Chi Winter Camp (PWC), which allowed me to collaborate with other board members, and meet high school students who were interested in committing to UCR. My duties as a Marketing Coordinator consisted of creating digital flyers for the PWC social media page, and monitoring the zoom room where PWC would take place, since it was an online event. I plan to continue going to Psi Chi meetings, keep up with my studies, and graduate by June 2026, so that I may go to graduate school and pursue a career in Occupational Therapy.
